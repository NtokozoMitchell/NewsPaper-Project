        <h3>Teenagers Spend Over 7 Hours a Day on Screens</h3>
        <p>
          A new study shows that the average teen now spends more time on their
          phone than sleeping. Many teenagers today are spending late nights glued to their phones, scrolling through social media, texting friends, or watching videos.
          This habit has become increasingly common with the rise of apps designed to capture users‚Äô attention for long periods.
          However,staying up late on phones can negatively affect teens sleep patterns and overall health.
          Lack of sleep often leads to poor concentration in school, mood swings, and fatigue during the day. Experts warn that the blue light from screens can also interfere with the body‚Äôs natural sleep cycle.
          Parents are encouraged to set boundaries and promote healthier bedtime routines. Ultimately, limiting phone use before bed can help teenagers rest better and improve their mental and physical well being.

        <h3>Remote Work: The Hidden Screen Trap</h3>
        <p>
          While remote jobs offer flexibility, they often increase total daily
          screen hours. Balancing work-life boundaries is crucial.Remote work allows people to work from home and have more freedom with their time.
          However, it also means spending more hours in front of screens. Many workers use computers for meetings, emails, and projects all day long.
          This can lead to eye strain, tiredness, and less time away from technology. Experts say it‚Äôs important to take breaks and move around during the day.
          Setting clear work hours can also help keep a healthy balance between work and home life. By managing screen time wisely, remote workers can stay productive and protect their well-being.
